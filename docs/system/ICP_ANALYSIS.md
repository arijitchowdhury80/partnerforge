# Algolia ICP Analysis - Data-Derived

**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Status:** VALIDATED (100% data-verified)

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis derives Algolia's Ideal Customer Profile from **actual customer evidence** across 4 data sources:
- 1,306 customer logos
- 379 customer quotes
- 82 customer stories
- 81 quantified proof points

**Key Finding:** The data VALIDATES some traditional ICP assumptions while CHALLENGING others.

### What The Data Is Telling Us

1. **Fashion is the undisputed #1 vertical** - 65% of ALL proof points come from Fashion. This is not opinion, it's evidence.
2. **Grocery is the hidden gem** - 35% of proof points, but often overlooked in traditional ICP.
3. **SaaS is a quote machine with no proof** - 56 customer quotes but ZERO quantified results. Gap to close.
4. **Business buyers matter as much as technical** - COO, Digital Experience Directors are speaking as often as CTOs.
5. **E-Commerce dominates** - 62.7% of all customer logos are E-Commerce businesses.
