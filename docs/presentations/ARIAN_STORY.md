# PART 1: THE PROBLEM

## Step 1: We Have Too Many Leads

Algolia has partnerships with Adobe, Amplience, Spryker, and other technology vendors. Through these partnerships, we can identify thousands of companies using partner technologies.

The problem is: we have approximately 2,800 accounts that use partner tech. We cannot pursue all of them equally.

## Step 2: Traditional Lead Scoring Fails

Traditional lead scoring assigns a single score to every account based on signals like traffic, company size, and technology.

But this approach treats all accounts equally. A SaaS company with high traffic gets the same score as a Fashion retailer with high traffic.

The data shows this is wrong. Fashion retailers deliver 65% of all Algolia's proof points. SaaS companies deliver zero.

They are not equal. They should not be scored equally.

## Step 3: We Need a Better Approach

We need a system that:
1. Filters accounts through multiple layers
2. Uses actual customer evidence to define priorities
3. Assigns the right sales plays and campaigns
4. Focuses our best effort on the best accounts

This is what Arian does.

# PART 2: THE DATA FOUNDATION

## Step 4: We Analyzed Actual Customer Evidence

Before building the system, we analyzed Algolia's actual customer evidence:
- 1,306 customer logos
- 379 customer quotes
- 82 customer stories
- 81 quantified proof points

This is not theoretical. This is what actually happened.

## Step 5: The Key Finding - Fashion and Grocery Win

When we analyzed where proof points come from (conversion uplift, revenue increase, measurable results), we found something surprising:

- Fashion: 65% of all proof points (53 out of 81)
- Grocery: 35% of all proof points (28 out of 81)
- Everyone else: 0%

No other vertical has quantified proof points. Not SaaS. Not Media. Not B2B.

Fashion and Grocery are where Algolia demonstrably wins.

## Step 6: This Defines Our Ideal Customer Profile

Based on the data, we defined Algolia's Ideal Customer Profile across six dimensions:

1. Vertical: Fashion and Grocery are Tier 1. General Retail and SaaS are Tier 2. Media is Tier 3.
2. Company Size: Enterprise ($500M+) is Tier 1. Mid-Market is Tier 2.
3. Geography: US and UK are Tier 1. EMEA is Tier 2.
4. Tech Stack: SFCC, Magento, Shopify Plus are top platforms.
5. Competitor: Companies using Elasticsearch, Solr, or SearchSpring are displacement opportunities.
6. Persona: CTO and VP Engineering are primary buyers.

This ICP is data-derived, not assumed.

# PART 3: THE FOUR-LAYER CASCADE

## Step 7: Layer 1 - Partner Tech Cohort

The first filter classifies accounts by their technology stack.

Not all tech stacks are equal. An account using Adobe AEM plus Salesforce Commerce Cloud plus AWS is more sophisticated than an account using just Shopify.

We define cohorts:
- JACKPOT: CMS + Commerce + Hyperscaler (or CMS + Commerce + Marketing)
- HIGH: CMS + Commerce
- MEDIUM: Commerce + Hyperscaler, or CMS + Marketing
- STANDARD: Commerce only, or CMS only
- LOW: Marketing only, or Hyperscaler only

JACKPOT accounts signal enterprise-grade investment, complex stacks, multiple decision-makers, and higher deal potential.

From 2,800 accounts, approximately 200 (7%) are JACKPOT.

## Step 8: Layer 2 - ICP Filter

The second filter scores JACKPOT accounts against our Ideal Customer Profile.

We calculate a composite score:
- Vertical contributes 25%
- Competitor displacement contributes 20%
- Company size contributes 15%
- Tech stack contributes 15%
- Persona access contributes 15%
- Geography contributes 10%

Accounts scoring 85-100 are ICP Tier 1.
Accounts scoring 70-84 are ICP Tier 2.
Accounts scoring below 70 are lower priority.

From 200 JACKPOT accounts, approximately 60 (30%) are ICP Tier 1.

## Step 9: Layer 3 - Sales Play Intersection

The third filter identifies which sales plays we can execute.

We have three sales plays:
- S1 (Tech Partner): The account uses partner technology
- S2 (Target List): The account is on our marketing or ABM list
- S3 (SI Connected): The account has a relationship with our SI partners like EPAM or Valtech

Accounts can be tagged with multiple plays. The more plays, the higher the priority.

- Triple Play (S1+S2+S3): Highest priority, validated from every angle
- Double Play (S1+S2 or S2+S3): High priority, multiple signals
- Single Play: Standard priority

We apply multipliers:
- Triple Play: 1.5x the ICP score
- Double Play: 1.25x the ICP score
- Single Play: 1.0x the ICP score

From 60 ICP Tier 1 accounts, approximately 15 are Triple Play.

## Step 10: Layer 4 - GTM Campaign

The fourth layer assigns specific campaigns based on the account's position in the funnel.

Triple Play accounts (10-15) get ABM 1:1 treatment:
- Hyper-personalized outreach
- Named account owner
- Custom research and search audit
- SI partner warm introduction
- Executive dinner or event invitation
- 8-touch sequence over 45 days

Double Play accounts (25-40) get ABM 1:Few treatment:
- Segment-based messaging
- Vertical-specific content
- 6-touch sequence over 30 days

Single Play accounts (50-100) get ABM 1:Many treatment:
- Programmatic outreach
- Automated sequences
- 5-touch sequence over 21 days

# PART 4: THE RESULT

## Step 11: The Funnel Math

Starting with 2,800 partner tech accounts:
- Layer 1 (JACKPOT): 200 accounts remain (7%)
- Layer 2 (ICP Tier 1): 60 accounts remain (2%)
- Layer 3 (Triple Play): 15 accounts remain (0.5%)
- Layer 4 (ABM 1:1): 10-15 accounts get premium treatment

From 2,800 accounts, we identify 10-15 that are the absolute highest priority.

## Step 12: What This Means

The 10-15 accounts that survive all four layers are the crème de la crème.

They have:
- Enterprise-grade tech stacks (JACKPOT)
- Perfect ICP fit (Fashion/Grocery + Enterprise + US/EMEA)
- Multiple sales plays (Tech Partner + Target List + SI Connected)
- Named personas to engage (CTO, COO, VP Digital)

These accounts get our best effort. They are most likely to close.

---

# PART 5: WHY THIS MATTERS

## Step 13: Without This System

Without Arian, we would:
- Treat 2,800 accounts equally
- Spray-and-pray outreach
- Waste AE time on low-fit accounts
- Have unclear prioritization
- See low response rates

## Step 14: With This System

With Arian, we:
- Focus on 10-15 highest-priority accounts for ABM 1:1
- Use data-driven prioritization
- Maximize AE productivity
- Have clear pipeline stages
- Expect higher response and conversion rates

## Step 15: The Philosophy

We are not scoring leads. We are building a sales machine.

The machine takes raw partner tech data and systematically refines it through four layers until we have the absolute best accounts to pursue.

Each layer has a clear purpose:
- Layer 1 asks: Do they have the right tech?
- Layer 2 asks: Do they fit our ICP?
- Layer 3 asks: What plays can we run?
- Layer 4 asks: How do we engage?

The accounts that survive all four layers are the crème de la crème. They get our best effort. They are most likely to close.

This is the Arian sales machinery.

# PART 6: NEXT STEPS

## Step 16: What We're Asking For

We request approval to implement this sales machinery as the foundation for Arian.

The approach is:
- Data-driven: Based on 1,848 customer evidence records
- Systematic: Four clear layers with defined filters
- Scalable: Can be automated and repeated
- Measurable: Clear metrics at each stage

## Step 17: Implementation Timeline

Week 1-2: Build cohort classification (Layer 1)
Week 2-3: Build ICP scoring (Layer 2)
Week 3-4: Build play tagging (Layer 3)
Week 4+: Execute campaigns (Layer 4)

## Step 18: Success Metrics

We will measure:
- JACKPOT accounts identified: Target 150-250
- ICP Tier 1 accounts: Target 50-80
- Triple Play accounts: Target 10-20
- ABM 1:1 response rate: Target >15%
- Pipeline generated: Target $X million
